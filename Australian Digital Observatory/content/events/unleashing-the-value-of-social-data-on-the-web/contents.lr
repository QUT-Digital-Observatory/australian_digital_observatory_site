  - Challenges that come with these data
2. *Some of the ways you can augment your research (including a demonstration)*
  - Getting started: where and how to get social data on the Web and best practices (including Web archive, existing data banks, data donation)
  - Scaling up - finding more relevant data efficiently and quickly, labelling/coding data. dealing with large, multiplatform, differently structured data
