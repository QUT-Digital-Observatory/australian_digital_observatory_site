body: The Australian Digital Observatory offers a diverse catalogue of tools, datasets, documentation, and services from all partner institutions and infrastructures to support the research communities. The goal of these resources is to assist researchers through the time-consuming tasks of exploring, collecting, tidying and modelling, storing and organising, analysing, and publishing data that might require specific technical skills.
