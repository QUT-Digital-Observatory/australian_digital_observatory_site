description:

- Design and build project-specific research data workflows, from collecting to storing to analysing data.
- Assist with collecting, storing and tidying data from the web.
- Build and maintain open-source and bespoke software to aid with data collection, storage, and analysis (e.g., [youte](/resources/youte/), [tidy_tweet](/resources/tidy-tweet), [tweetexploR](/resources/tweetexplor)).
- We are actively exploring the use of large language models (LLMs) for research and can provide consultancy on potential applications of LLMs for your research.
