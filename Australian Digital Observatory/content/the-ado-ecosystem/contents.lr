The Australian Digital Observatory (ADO) is curating an [ecosystem of resources](../resources) for researchers working with digital human data from the internet. This ecosystem is intended to be useful to a wide range of disciplines, particularly humanities and social sciences, data science, public health, business, law, and many others.

Research projects are, by definition, all unique: the very purpose of research is to make new contributions. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all system for obtaining and pre-processing research data, especially in the humanities and social sciences. However, there are many overlapping methods and skills that are part of the research data lifecycle including (but not limited to) collecting, tidying, analysing, and publishing data.

The ADO ecosystem aims to equip researchers with a set of modular, open source, interoperable methods and processes to assist with these tasks. Researchers can engage with and benefit from the ADO ecosystem by accessing tools, training, and project support services.

This modular ecosystem approach gives flexibility, allowing researchers to pick and choose [resources](../resources) that are relevant and suitable for them, without being locked in to a specific stack (e.g., proprietary formats/tools, specific cloud infrastructure). The modular approach also recognises different entry levels in terms of researchersâ€™ skills and needs. Furthermore, smaller tools are easier to maintain, and focusing on modularity and interoperability allows making use of and supporting existing tools and resources already in the community rather than reinventing the wheel.

In designing and curating the ADO ecosystem, we take inspiration from the open source software community and [the Unix philosophy](https://medium.com/ingeniouslysimple/philosophy-of-unix-development-aa0104322491) of designing interoperable tools that each do one thing well, and from foundational tooling ecosystems such as [the R Tidyverse](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/#:~:text=The%20tidyverse%20is%20a%20coherent,being%20expanded%20by%20several%20contributors.), which has well demonstrated the suitability of such a structure to the academic research environment. We hope to learn from these communities, and also to contribute back to them.
