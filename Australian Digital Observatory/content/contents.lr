The [Australian Digital Observatory](https://ardc.edu.au/project/australian-digital-observatory/)
is an [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au) platform working to establish a national
infrastructure for accessing and analysing dynamic digital data, including existing
collections of national interest across Twitter, FlickR, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and
gaming platforms such as Steam.

The Australian Digital Observatory will create an interdisciplinary team of data science
researchers and support staff at key locations around Australia who will offer
data-related services, training, and research support in data collection, storage,
tidying, pre-processing, analytics, and visualisation to support academicsâ€™ research
data pipelines. These tasks can be time-consuming and often involve a steep learning
curve for specific technical skills. The Australian Digital Observatory can reduce or
eliminate this burden so that researchers can focus on analysis and interpretation.
